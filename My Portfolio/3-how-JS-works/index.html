        <h1>Section 3: How Javascript Works Behind the Scenes</h1>
        <h2>
            Execution Context:
        </h2>
        <p>A box, a container or a wrapper which stores variables in which a piece of our code is evaluated and executed</p>
        <h2>Global Execution Context </h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Code is <b>not inside any function</b></li>
                <li>Associated with the <b>Global Object</b></li>
                <li>In the browser, that's the window object</li>
            </ul>
            lastName === window.lastName 
            // true
        </p>

    <h2>The Variable Object</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The argument object is created, containing all the arguments that were passed into  the function.</li>
        <h3>Hoisting: </h3>
        <li>Code is scanned for cuntion declarations: for each function, a property is created in the Variable Object, <b>pointing to the function.</b></li>
        <li>Code is scanned for <b>variable declarations: </b>for each variable, a property is created in the Variable Object, and set to undefined.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Difference between functions and variables: Functions are already defined before the execution starts</p>

    <h2>Scoping in JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Scoping answers the question "where can we access a certain variable?"
            </li>
            <li><b>Each new function creates a scope: </b> the space/environment, in which the variables it defines are accessible.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Lexical Scoping:</b> a function that is lexically within another function gets access to the scope of the outer function.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</section>
    <section>
        <h2>The 'THIS' Variable</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Regular Function Call: </b>The this keyword points at a global object (the window object, in the broswer).</li>
                <li><b>Method Call: </b>The this variable points to the object that is calling the method.</li>
                <li><em>The </em><b>this </b><em>keyword is not assigned a value until a function where it is defined is actually called.</em></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
